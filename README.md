    BALLOON POP
    
    HOW TO PLAY: In Baloon Pop, balloons are raining down from the sky, and it's
    your job to pop them all. They will appear at the top of the screen and
    slowly make their way down to the bottom, where you stand. You can fire
    darts upward in a straight line to pop the balloons. However, once the darts
    are fired, their direction cannot be changed. If the dart hits a balloon,
    the balloon is popped and you get a point. If the dart misses, it will
    disappear upon hitting the top of the screen. If a balloon reaches the
    ground without being popped, you will lose one of three lives. Lose all
    lives and it's game over!
