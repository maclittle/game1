    BALLOON DODGE
    
    HOW TO PLAY: In Balloon Dodge, balloons are raining down from the sky, and it's
    your job to avoid them all. They will appear at the top of the screen and
    slowly make their way down to the bottom, where you stand. You can move left and right to dodge the     balloons as they fall, but be careful not to get hit! For every balloon you successfully dodge, you get a point. When a balloon hits the bottom of the screen it will disappear, and a new one will spawn at the top. If a balloon makes contact with your player, you will lose one of three lives. Lose all
    lives and it's game over!
    
    CONTROLS:
    Move left with the left arrow key
    Move right with the right arrow key
